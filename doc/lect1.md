## Tutorials

+ [Github101](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
+ [Linux101](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php#introduction)
    + especially, see [Piping](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php#introduction) and
      [Shebangs](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/scripting.php).
      Origins of "shebang" (wikipeida): an executable file starting with an interpreter
      directive is simply called a script, often prefaced with the name
      or general classification of the intended interpreter. The name
      shebang for the distinctive two characters may have come from
      an inexact contraction of SHArp bang or haSH bang, referring to
      the two typical Unix names for them. Another theory on the sh in
      shebang is that it is from the default shell sh, usually invoked
      with shebang. This usage was current by December 1989,
      and probably earlier.
+ [Prolog](https://www.cpp.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/contents.html):  used in Project1a.
